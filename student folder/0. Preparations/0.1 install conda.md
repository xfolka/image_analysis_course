# ðŸš€ How to Install Miniconda on Windows

## 1. Download Miniconda
- Official page: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/success](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
- Under  "Miniconda Installers", Choose the right installer for your system or just click download:  
  - **Windows 64-bit (recommended):** `Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit`  
  - **Windows 32-bit (rare, older PCs):** `Miniconda3 Windows 32-bit`  

Download the `.exe` installer.

## 2. Installation notes
When running the installer, youâ€™ll be asked a few key things:  

- **Installation type:** choose *Just Me* unless you want all users to have access.  
- **Installation path:** the default (`C:\Users\<username>\Miniconda3`) is fine.  
- **Options:**  
  - âœ” Register Miniconda as the default Python 3.x  
  - (Optional) Add Miniconda to PATH â€” only if you want to use `conda` in any terminal. Otherwise, you can just use the **Anaconda Prompt**.

## 3. Verify installation
Open **Anaconda Prompt** (installed automatically with Miniconda) and run:  

```bash
conda --version
```

You should see something like:  

```
conda 24.5.0
```

## 4. Create a project environment from `imganalysis.yml`
You can define your dependencies in a YAML file. Example `imganalysis.yml`:

```yaml
name: imganalysis
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.12
  - jupyter
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - seaborn
```
This file is already created and is the same folder as this file.
Get it here: [imganalysis.yml](imganalysis.yml)
(If you want to you can copy the snippet above, save it to a file called 'imganalysis.yml', and follow the steps below using your own file instead)

### Steps:
1. In **Anaconda Prompt**, navigate to that folder:  
   ```bash
   cd path\to\your\project
   ```
2. Create the environment:  
   ```bash
   conda env create -f imganalysis.yml
   ```
3. Activate it:  
   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

Now you have Python, Jupyter, and core data science libraries ready to use ðŸŽ‰.


<!-- ## 4. Create and manage environments
Example: create a new environment with Python 3.11:  

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.11
```

Activate the environment:  
```bash
conda activate myenv
```

Deactivate it:  
```bash
conda deactivate
``` -->

âœ… Done! Miniconda is now installed, and you can start managing isolated environments and packages on your Windows machine.
