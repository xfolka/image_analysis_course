# üìù Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Jupyter Notebook Extension on Windows

## 1. Download and Install VS Code
- Official page: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
- Download the **Windows installer (User Installer 64-bit)**.  
- Run the `.exe` and follow the installer (default settings are fine).  

After installation, you should be able to launch **Visual Studio Code**.

---

## 2. Install Python (if not already installed)
- If you‚Äôve already installed **Miniconda**, you can skip this step.  
- Otherwise, make sure Python is available on your system (e.g. via [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).  

Check Python from terminal (Command Prompt or Anaconda Prompt):  

```bash
python --version
```

---

## 3. Install the Python Extension in VS Code
1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. Go to the **Extensions Marketplace** (left sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).  
3. Search for **Python** and install the official extension by *Microsoft*.  

This extension provides Python language support and is required for Jupyter.

---

## 4. Install the Jupyter Extension in VS Code
1. In the Extensions Marketplace, search for **Jupyter**.  
2. Install the official **Jupyter** extension by *Microsoft*.  

This allows you to open, edit, and run `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) files directly in VS Code.

<!-- ---

## 5. Install Jupyter in Your Environment
If you‚Äôre using Miniconda/conda, run in **Anaconda Prompt**:  

```bash
conda install jupyter
```

Or, if you prefer `pip`:  

```bash
pip install notebook
``` -->

---

## 5. Verify Jupyter in VS Code
1. Open VS Code.  
2. Create or open a file with `.ipynb` extension.  
3. At the top right, you should see a **kernel selector**.  
4. Choose the Python environment (e.g. your conda environment).  

Now you can run notebook cells with `Shift+Enter` inside VS Code üéâ.

---

‚úÖ Done! You now have VS Code set up with full Jupyter Notebook support.
